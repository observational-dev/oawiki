# Stub Template

## Please don't actually edit; it's a template for all the others

It looks like this page hasn't been written yet. Would you be willing to [help](https://github.com/observational-dev/oawiki/blob/main/README.md)?

% This line won't show up on the wiki, cuz it starts with a %. Anyway, it's here to give you some tips editing. You can delete these bits at your convenience.

% The preview in GitHub will be close to how the page will look on the wiki, but not quite exact. For fomatting examples, see examplepage source and examplepage on the wiki - respectively https://github.com/observational-dev/oawiki/blob/main/src/other/examplepage.md?plain=1 and https://wiki.observational.space/other/examplepage.html

% Once you've made changes, you will commit them, with a commit message like "wrote base article of Vorpal Blades (yourname)" or "added section for jabberwalk tips (yourname)". Next GitHub will talk about forking the repository, which you'll want to do, and then you'll open a pull request with your changes. After that, a maintainer will greenlight it and merge it into the site. For more details, you can check https://github.com/observational-dev/oawiki/blob/main/README.md or ask in the discord - we are grateful for all your help writing the wiki and want to make it as easy as possible :)
