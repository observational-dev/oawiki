# Example Page

Rather than being intended for wiki viewers, this page exists for wiki editors. You could be one!

[See the source](https://github.com/observational-dev/oawiki/blob/main/src/other/examplepage.md?plain=1) for this page, to see how to make these fun formattings.

## Markdown Examples

If you've used Discord or Reddit, these might be familiar to you.

**Text that is bolded**

_Italicized text_

~~struckthrough text~~

fun `inline code` format[^myref]
% this line is a comment, and won't be displayed on the wiki. I just wanted to point out that the footnote definitions will always be displayed at the end of the page, but it's useful to define them near where they are used.

[^myref]: This is the footnote definition for the reference above. It will be shown at the bottom of the page, and is automatically numbered.

A quick markdown [cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/) is available, as well as a [comprehensive catalog](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/typography.html#syntax-core) for MyST's implementation which is used here.

...And a cat image for you:[^catref]

> This is a blockquote. It's useful for separating out a specific chunk of text from the rest. Glass does not flow at room temperature as a high-viscosity liquid. Although glass shares some molecular properties with liquids, it is a solid at room temperature and only begins to flow at hundreds of degrees above room temperature. Old glass which is thicker at the bottom than at the top comes from the production process, not from slow flow; no such distortion is observed in other glass objects of similar or even greater age

## Tricks Beyond Markdown

You can do some neat dropdown bits if you want:

```{dropdown} What does a dropdown look like?

Like this :)

```

```{dropdown} That's cool, can you do another, fancier one?
:icon: comment-discussion
:animate: fade-in-slide-down
Absolutely! It's documented [here](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dropdowns.html), with the change that we use backticks instead of colon fences.

% This line is a comment and will not show up on the wiki page.
% It's like a secret for wiki editors only.

> Fill some space for the important cat pic to the right. Irregardless is a word. Nonstandard, slang, or colloquial terms used by English speakers are sometimes alleged not to be real words, despite appearing in numerous dictionaries. All words in English became accepted by being commonly used for a certain period of time; thus, there are many vernacular words currently not accepted as part of the standard language, or regarded as inappropriate in formal speech or writing, but the idea that they are not words is a misconception. Other examples of words that are sometimes alleged not to be words include burglarize, licit, and funnest which appear in numerous dictionaries as English words.

> Lightning can, and often does, strike the same place twice. Lightning in a thunderstorm is more likely to strike objects and spots that are more prominent or conductive. For instance, lightning strikes the Empire State Building in New York City on average 23 times per year.

> The lift force is not generated by the air taking the same time to travel above and below an aircraft's wing. This misconception, sometimes called the equal transit-time fallacy, is widespread among textbooks and non-technical reference books, and even appears in pilot training materials. In fact, the air moving over the top of an aerofoil generating lift is always moving much faster than the equal transit theory would imply, as described in the incorrect and correct explanations of lift force.
