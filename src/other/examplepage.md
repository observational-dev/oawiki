## Markdown Examples

If you've used Discord or Reddit, these might be familiar to you.

_Italicized text_

~~struckthrough text~~

fun `inline code` format

Here is a link to the markdown we use: [Commonmark Help](https://commonmark.org/help/) and a cat image for you:

> This is a blockquote. It's useful for separating out a specific chunk of text from the rest. Glass does not flow at room temperature as a high-viscosity liquid. Although glass shares some molecular properties with liquids, it is a solid at room temperature and only begins to flow at hundreds of degrees above room temperature. Old glass which is thicker at the bottom than at the top comes from the production process, not from slow flow; no such distortion is observed in other glass objects of similar or even greater age

## Tricks Beyond Markdown

You can do some neat dropdown bits if you want:

```{dropdown} What does a dropdown look like?

Like this :)

```

```{dropdown} That's cool, can you do another, fancier one?
:icon: comment-discussion
:animate: fade-in-slide-down
Absolutely! It's documented [here](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dropdowns.html), with the change that we use backticks instead of colon fences.
