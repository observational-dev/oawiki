# Ernest's List

Ernest of the [astro-talks.ru](https://astro-talks.ru) forum has been
single-handedly making objective comparisons between eyepieces possible. The
table below has been adapted from DarkDiver's tables, which themselves were
modified from Ernest's original <!-- Note that the link below is specified as an href because commonmark can't
handle ampersands apparently (???!) --> <a
href="https://astro-talks.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=1483">post in the
astro-talks eyepieces forum</a>. DarkDiver split Ernest's list into separate
standard and zoom tables, and added measured field stops and calculated AFOV.
