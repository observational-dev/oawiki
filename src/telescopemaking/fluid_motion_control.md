| Device          | Comment                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FRT-E2/E9       | Useful for tiny scopes; have very low torque                                                                                                                             |
| FRT-G2/C2       | Might be useful for small scopes, particularly with reduced ratio installation                                                                                           |
| FRT-D2          | Might be useful for small-to-medium scopes with reduced ratio installation                                                                                               |
| FRT-L1          | Might be useful for small-to-medium scopes with 1-1 installations or small scopes with reduced ratios                                                                    |
| FRT-K2/F2       | Unsuitable due to motion/backlash from internal design/build tolerances (4 units tested)                                                                                 |
| FDT-47A         | Useful disk-type dampers for small-to-medium scopes with 1-1 installations or larger scopes with reduced ratios. Have passthrough capability and wider temperature range |
| FDT-57A/63A/70A | Similar to FDT-47A with 1-1 capacity capable of handling even larger scopes. These are physically larger bodied, and have larger square inputs.                          |
