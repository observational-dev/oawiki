# A Mirror Maker's Guide to Baking Tiles 
submitted by user: @madeo__

The name of this guide is slightly deceiving as sadly we do not get to bake tiles, but this will not be too far off it. This guide will be about learning the method of making a tool with the tiles already attached via the method “baking them in”. 

 

### Step 1: Prepping Your Blank 

Before we pour the plaster, we want to make sure our blank is nice and safe from the plaster. To do this, we will first wrap the curved surface of our blank with saran wrap to ensure no plaster gets on the surface of the blank. Next, we will want to build walls around the blank, so the plaster stays in place. Commonly a hard but flexible plastic like posterboard plastic is wrapped tightly and secured around the blank to make walls. Once you have done these steps, your blank should look something like this. 

 

### Step 2: Setting Tiles 

Now that our blank is prepped, it is time to set our tiles on the blank. This is simple to do as all you need to do is grab your tile sheet, cut the appropriate shape of tiles, and set them on your blank. Once you have done this, your blank will look something like this.  



### Step 3: Pouring Plaster 

Once the tiles are on the blank, it is time to make and pour our plaster. If you ordered your plaster from a site like Firsthand Discovery, they would have included instructions for making plaster, and those are fine to follow. If not, then I would highly recommend looking up some instructions for making plaster. As for the pour, it is as simple as pouring the plaster into the mold you have made around your blank. Try to fill your mold up to the top and flatten the top by pushing small plaster hills down with a ruler or another long, flat object. Once the plaster has been poured and the top has been flattened, let your plaster set for 30-45 minutes before removing the mold. Once poured, your blank should look like this. 

 

And now you have a completed tool! The curved surface of your tool might look a little messy from the get-go, but after a little bit of grinding all the extra plaster will get ground away. Enjoy using your new tool!
