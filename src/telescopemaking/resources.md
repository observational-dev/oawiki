# Telescope Making Resources

Below are some of the most commonly recommended resources for designing telescopes. These things range from general Newtonian design, literature, optical testing practices, and much more.

## General Newtonian Design

[Newtonian Telescope Designer by Mel Bartels](https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/NewtDesigner.html)

- Comprehensive Newtonian telescope building tool
- Interlinked calculators that produce accurate and quantitative measurements
- Intuitive design with huge amount of variables to play with

[Stellafane's "Building a Dobsonian Telescope"](https://stellafane.org/tm/dob/index.html)

- Useful page cataloging traditional sonotube design
- Describes useful woodworking concepts

[The Dobsonian Telescope by Kriege and Berry](https://shopatsky.com/products/dobsonian-telescope?variant=40765870178456)

- Large volume with critical measurements for traditional "truss dob" design
- Helpful for very large aperture dobsonians

## Refractor Design

[Amateur Telescope Making Vol. 2](https://shopatsky.com/products/amateur-telescope-making-vol-2)

- part of a series written by Ingalls, Vol 2. talks about refractor telescopes

## Equatorial Platforms

## Spiders

## Truss Designs

## Mirror Making

[How to Make a Telescope by Jean Texerau](https://shopatsky.com/products/how-to-make-a-telescope-2nd-ed?variant=40766495359128)

- Detailed plans for creating optical mirrors
- Includes mirror testing diagrams and protocols
