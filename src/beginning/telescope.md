# Telescope

A telescope is any device used to determine the nature of a distant object. The medium by which the object is observed depends on the design of the telescope. Most often, this includes anything on the electromagnetic spectrum measured by an object's reflection, emission, or absorption of light. Depending on who you ask, other telescopes include gravity wave detectors, pulsar timing arrays, x-ray detectors, neutrino detectors, and more.

Wavelengths of light are the most sensible way to make meaningful directed observations. For human visual observers, this always means using visible light- what we can detect with our eyes. For cameras, sensors, and detectors, this can include almost anything on the electromagnetic spectrum, from long radio waves to microscopic gamma waves. A telescope can be pointed towards a target, and a measurement in the wavelength of the detector can be taken.

In this article, we focus on astronomically significant telescopes- telescopes that are useful for astronomy.

## History of Astronomical Telescopes

Astronomy originated with human observers recording naked-eye observations of celestial objects. Careful naked-eye observations laid the foundation for future astronomical observations made with telescopes. Apparent magnitude, orbital mechanics, the lunar month, notable comets, supernovae (sometimes called guest stars), and measurements of the solar year all originated with naked eye observations and careful record-keeping among ancient astronomers.
